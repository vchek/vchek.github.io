       Food Transparency has become a problem within big companies as consumers have become more aware of what they are putting into their bodies. Companies have tried to beat around the bush by giving us
      words like "fat free" or "sugar free" making their food seem healthier or better than other brands. They have also tried to promote how they use the freshest ingredients or best qualitiy 
      ingredients while never giving proof. An example of a company who does not tell their consumers where their products come from would be Papa Johns. Yes, Papa Johns does list their ingredients and nutritional information but it 
      does not tell you where they get their ingredients from. In contrast their are big food companies like Whole foods that let you know almost everything. The company has put out a break down to gmo transparency on their  
      website so we know how their food meets requirements for an organic (thus non-GMO) or non-GMO-verified label. They break it down per section like ; meats, packaged food, fresh produce and the 
      seafood depeartment just to name a few. Panera Bread  also uses videos, articles, press releases and reports to communicate its transparency efforts. The company keeps the public updated on
      progress toward goals through content like the animal welfare infographic.
