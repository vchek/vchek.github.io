       <p>
      Hello my name is Tionne Thornton and I am a current 10th grader at Saint John Neumann Maria Goretti highschool. 
       I enjoy learning new things, solving problems and allowing my voice to be heard, all reasons on why I decided to come to this program.
       I come from a coding background but all of this was somewhat new to me due to the fact that this is my first time learning HTML and creating a website. At first this was challenging 
       but with help of my mentor Victor everything was ok!  
       I am very excited for you guys to see what me and my partners have worked so hard on and I hope that you learn something from our page 
       and become more aware of what you are putting into your body.

     <div class="container">
     <p>
      Hello! My name is Maesah Albaki and I am a high school student who is still new to coding. This website that my partners and I created is one of my first projects where I created and collaborated on code. 
      My mentor, Gianna, was patient and extremely helpful. Anything we didn't know we would research together. The more I worked on the website, the more I became confident about our work and the importance of bringing
      awareness and creating action in regards to our isse. The issue that we chose was one that I did not know much about. I never took the time to think about how much our food is being manipulated and controlled by 
      these large corporations with an abundance of influence. I am so proud of what we created and I hope those viewing our work will learn something. You might even be inspired to embark on a solution that would
      change our food situation; if that's the case, then please let us know because we would love to hear your ideas.
