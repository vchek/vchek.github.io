        In recent years, food addiction in the U.S. has become rampent and obesity rates are increasing. Sugar is naturally present within foods, such as grapes, and salt is a welcome addition to many meals. Fast food meals,
    such as KFC's Double Down sandwhich, is a prime example of how corporations, such as PepsiCo (the parent corporation), manipulate consumer's sugar and salt intake. These meals are oversaturated with refined salts, sugars, 
    fats, and oils that are linked to obesity, high blood sugar, and increased cholesterol rates. It is refined for the purpose of enhancing the flavor of the product while maintaining its affordable price. This creates an 
    effect in our bodies that makes it significantly harder to resist foods composed of refined carbs and fats. In recent years, M&Ms have been the top selling candy in the United States, with over $670 million in yearly
    sales.
